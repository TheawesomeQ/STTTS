# STTTS
Speech To Text To SPeech

This is a project to automatically convert your voice to text to speech. This project was inspired by Zentreya's voice.
I saw no other projects doing this so I took a shot at it. It is janky and doesn't work that great. Optimally you will need to adjust your settings so that the timeout period, and the background noise thresholds are good for your microphone and environment.

# Prerequisite: 
- Install a program to re-route audio, such as VoiceMeeter
- Windows must have the voice you want installed
# To use:
1) Open voicemeeter
2) Run STTTS exe. The program will use your default microphone.
3) Use windows "App volume and device preferences" to set the python audio output to the VoiceMeeter input
4) In discord, or any game that supports it, select VoiceMeeter output as your input device

This means games which don't let you choose your audio input device won't work for this.
I will try to improve the instructions here later, maybe with a video tutorial or something.
